# website-style-guide
Codecademy Project aiming to create a website style guide. I collected colors and fonts that I would want to refer to in future projects. I then compiled the information in an HTML file and CSS file to practice and display the information. I will like continue to add to this project as I continue learning. 

# Systems Used
- Phoenix Code: very useful for previewing my coding output while working
- VS Code: still very useful for confirming HTML5 structural coding and metadata that automatically populates

# Resources Used
